### Hello there! 👋

I'm Szymon, passionate about automation, electronics, and machine learning. By education, I'm an electronics engineer, but my passion lies in multiple areas.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into various aspects of DevOps and process automation, focusing on creating scalable, reliable systems.

💼 I'm also interested in embedded systems, where I blend my electronics knowledge with programming to work on low-level, high-performance projects.

🧠 I'm primarily self-taught, constantly learning from various resources, exploring new frameworks, and experimenting with different technologies to solve real-world problems.

🔧 Languages and tools I'm proficient in:

Programming: C/C++ 💻, Python 🐍, SQL 🛢️, Bash/Linux 🐧
DevOps: Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, AWS 🚀, GitHub Actions ⚙️
Electronics: ESP32, Arduino, PCB design 🛠️

📂 Projects and interests: In my repositories, you'll find projects spanning:
- Embedded Systems: Projects involving microcontrollers and IoT, blending hardware with software.
- AI/ML: Practical machine learning applications, from data preprocessing to neural networks.
- DevOps: Automations, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud infrastructure.

📈 Current Focus:
- Optimizing DevOps workflows for CI/CD efficiency.
- Deepening my understanding of cloud architecture with AWS.
- Experimenting with machine learning in embedded environments.
